# JavaScript Toy Problems

This project includes three simple JavaScript programs designed to solve specific challenges: Student Grade Generator, Speed Detector, and Net Salary Calculator.

## Challenge 1: Student Grade Generator

This function prompts the user to enter student marks (between 0 and 100) and outputs the corresponding grade based on the following scale:
- **A**: Marks greater than 79
- **B**: Marks between 60 and 79
- **C**: Marks between 49 and 59
- **D**: Marks between 40 and 49
- **E**: Marks less than 40

### How to Run
1. Open Chrome and press `Ctrl + Shift + I` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd + Option + I` (Mac) to open Developer Tools.
2. Go to the Console tab.
3. Copy and paste the `studentGradeGenerator()` function code.
4. Call the function in the Console by typing `studentGradeGenerator()` and pressing `Enter`.
5. Enter the student marks when prompted.

## Challenge 2: Speed Detector

This program takes the speed of a car as input and calculates demerit points:
- If the speed is less than 70, it prints "Ok."
- For every 5 km/s above the speed limit (70), it gives one demerit point.
- If demerit points exceed 12, it prints "License suspended."

### How to Run
1. Open the Developer Tools in Chrome as described above.
2. Go to the Console tab.
3. Copy and paste the `speedDetector()` function code.
4. Call the function in the Console by typing `speedDetector()` and pressing `Enter`.
5. Enter the car speed when prompted.

## Challenge 3: Net Salary Calculator

This program calculates an individual's net salary based on inputs for basic salary and benefits. It calculates tax, NHIF deductions, NSSF deductions, gross salary, and net salary.

### How to Run
1. Open the Developer Tools in Chrome.
2. Go to the Console tab.
3. Copy and paste the `netSalaryCalculator()` function code.
4. Call the function in the Console by typing `netSalaryCalculator()` and pressing `Enter`.
5. Enter the basic salary and benefits when prompted.

## Conclusion

These programs are basic JavaScript exercises to help understand input handling, conditional logic, and arithmetic operations. Feel free to modify and enhance them as needed.
